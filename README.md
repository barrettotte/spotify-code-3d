# spotify-code-3d

Generate 3D-printable keychain thing for Spotify codes in one command.

I came across [this Thingiverse post](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4758473) and thought it'd be cool to
automate it. Additionally, I wanted a really small OpenSCAD project to work on.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- OpenSCAD 

## Usage

Tool Lateralus - `spotify:album:5l5m1hnH4punS1GQXgEi3T`
